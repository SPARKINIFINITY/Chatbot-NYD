It balances both long-term investing (wealth building) and short-term trading (profit strategies), and emphasizes learning progressively while managing risk. Each week covers key topics with practical steps, recommended resources, and risk-minimization tips. Week 1: Introduction to Stock Markets & Brokerage Accounts Begin with stock market fundamentals : learn that a stock is a share of company ownership, and markets (NSE/BSE) facilitate buying/selling these securities. The Indian market has a primary segment (new issues) and a secondary segment (trading existing shares) . Understand the role of the SEBI regulator (protecting investors and ensuring fairness) . Complete your KYC and open a Demat + trading account with a broker (e.g. Zerodha, Groww). Explore the trading platform interface and try placing a fake order using a simulator . Key Tasks: Grasp basic concepts (stocks, indices, brokers, bid/ask, market orders). Open a Demat/ account (e.g. with Zerodha Kite or Groww ) and get comfortable with the UI. Use beginner tutorials (Zerodha Varsity’s “Introduction to Stock Markets” module and Groww’s Basics of Investing articles ) to learn terminology. Practical Tools: Browse Zerodha’s free Varsity modules or Groww’s “Investment Basics” guide . Consider virtual trading apps like Neostox , which use real market data with virtual money , so you can practice order placement without real risk. Risk Tip: Start very small or use paper trading. Treat Week 1 as orientation – don’t risk any large capital. Using a simulator helps you “practice first” safely . Week 2: Market Structure, Participants & Operations Dive into how markets work and who participates. Learn about stock exchanges (NSE, BSE), trading hours, and settlement (trades today, delivery in T+1/T+2 days). Know the roles of brokers, sub-brokers, depositories (NSDL/CDSL), and clearing corporations, as explained by NISM . Study major stock indices (Sensex, Nifty) which track market performance. Topics: Understand how to buy/sell shares (order entry, limit/market orders, margins) and what KYC/ Demat/Trading A/C mean. See how IPOs list shares in the primary market. Learn key terms (derivatives, F&O basics) but don’t trade them yet. Resources: Use official guides or videos (e.g., SEBI’s investor education on how to buy/sell shares ). Read Zerodha’s Getting Started series or watch a beginner tutorial on using Kite . Risk Tip: Beware of fees and leverage."}

Investing focuses on wealth building over years (compounding, dividends), while trading (day/swing) aims for short-term profits. Decide your goals and risk appetite. For example, SIPs in mutual funds or index ETFs can start your long-term journey, while paper-trading simple intraday strategies sharpens trading skills. Focus: Study basic financial goals (retirement, big purchases). Learn about SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) and power of compounding . Understand that intraday or swing traders often use technical signals, whereas investors use fundamentals. Resources: Look up examples of long-term success stories (e.g. “Coffee Can Investing” strategy) . Read articles on equity investing vs. trading (Groww’s chapter on Differences Between Investing and Trading ). Risk Tip: For beginners, emphasize long-term safety: diversify into index funds or blue-chip stocks. If trading, always use stop-loss orders and never use 100% margin. Commit only risk capital you can afford to lose. Week 4: Fundamental Analysis (Long-Term Investing) Start analyzing companies you might invest in. Learn to read basic financial statements (P&L, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow) and corporate reports. Key metrics include P/E ratio, P/B ratio, ROE, debt/equity , and revenue growth. Understand industry factors and economic cycles. Topics: Learn how companies make money and how stock prices relate to earnings. Study sectors and business models. Familiarize yourself with reading annual reports (e.g. management discussion, risks). Tools: Use financial websites or apps (Screener .in, Moneycontrol) to look up stock fundamentals. Check Groww’s guides on evaluating stocks and understanding financial ratios . For example, P/E and EPS are crucial for valuing companies . Resources: Free online courses (NSE Academy Financial Markets – Beginner level) can help. Risk Tip: Verify data from multiple sources. Don’t rely on one number; use ratios to compare similar companies. Avoid over-leveraged firms. Always consider company debt and cash position before investing. Week 5: Technical Analysis (Trading Tools) Learn the basics of chart reading and technical indicators for trading. Study candlestick patterns, support and resistance lines, and trends. Familiarize yourself with simple indicators like Moving Averages , Relative Strength Index (RSI) , and MACD . Understand chart timeframes (1-min, daily) and how indicators lag or signal momentum. Topics: Practice"}

Always combine analysis with a stop-loss rule. Backtest any new strategy on historical data or a simulator first. Do not trade on rumor; trust your own analysis. Week 6: Trading Strategies & Risk Management Practice simple trading strategies (e.g. trend following, breakout trading) while tightening risk controls. For example, an intraday trader might buy at support and set a stop-loss just below, or use a 1:2 reward:risk target. Learn position sizing: risk only a small percentage of capital per trade. Stop-loss orders are essential. Diversify trades across timeframes and instruments to avoid “putting all eggs in one basket” . Strategies: Explore day trading (closing positions before market close) vs swing trading (holding a few days). Use trailing stops or fixed stops. Test breakout or pullback strategies on multiple charts. Risk Management: Implement diversification (across sectors or stocks) to mitigate sector-specific risks . Use a trading journal to analyze performance. The QuantInsti blog notes diversification and proper position sizing are core to limiting losses . Practice: Continue paper trading; compare different strategies’ outcomes. Use the Neostox app or Webull’s simulator (even for Indian stocks, many platforms allow global paper trading) . Risk Tip: Never trade based on tips; use your own analysis. Cap max loss per trade (e.g. 1–2% of portfolio). Always have a clear exit plan. Week 7: Portfolio Building & Diversification Shift focus to building a balanced portfolio for long-term growth. Combine stocks across sectors (like tech, finance, consumer goods) and consider other asset classes (debt funds, gold, government bonds). Include index funds or ETFs for broad market exposure. Aim for a mix of large-cap stability and a few mid/small caps for growth. Portfolio: Decide your mix based on age and goals (more equity if younger). Consider systematic investments (monthly SIPs) in mutual funds or index ETFs to automate diversification. Tools: Use mutual fund platforms (Groww, Zerodha Coin) to create SIPs. Research via sites like Morningstar or Moneycontrol for mutual fund ratings. Resources: Books like Coffee Can"}

Study SEBI regulations on trading (KYC, DP guidelines, short-selling rules) and understand SEBI’s investor protection mission . Note SEBI has introduced things like a T+1 settlement cycle (faster trade completion) and optional same-day (T+0) trading for top stocks . Taxes: Know that Short-Term Capital Gains (STCG) on equities (held ≤1 year) are taxed at 15%, while Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) (held >1 year) are taxed at 12.5% on gains above ₹1.25 lakh per year• 14 • • 15 1415 • 5 • • • • 10 • 15 2 16 • 3 . (Example: gains above ₹1.25L face 12.5% tax ). Also pay Securities Transaction Tax (STT) and applicable health cess. Compliance: Keep accurate records of buy/sell dates and prices (for tax). Use tools like Zerodha’s Console or Quicko for tax filing . Be aware of derivatives regulations (if you venture into F&O later). Platform Tips: Learn platform-specific features: e.g. Zerodha Kite’s bracket orders, Groww’s IPO application process. Zerodha’s support (Z-Connect) and Groww’s help section explain fees and procedures. Risk Tip: Avoid impulsive trades around fiscal year-end; tax implications can affect net returns. Use limit orders to control purchase/sell prices. Always check contract notes for brokerage charges to minimize costs. Week 9: Tools, Platforms & Simulators Familiarize yourself with practical trading/investing tools. Choose a beginner-friendly broker app: experts recommend Zerodha Kite , Groww , or Upstox for newcomers because of their intuitive interface and educational support. These platforms let you trade stocks and many offer mutual funds, ETFs, and F&O access. Recommended Apps: Install trading apps and paper-trade on them. For example, Zerodha Kite (with Varsity tutorials) and Groww (with articles) are popular . Other major brokers (ICICI Direct, HDFC Securities, Angel One) offer research tools and advisories as you advance. Application Tip: Link your bank account for fund transfers (under RBI’s LRS if planning foreign investment later), and try out demo modes. Simulators: Practice with virtual trading platforms. Neostox offers ₹1 crore virtual portfolio with real-time Indian market data , allowing you to test strategies without loss. (Webull’s simulator"}

SEBI’s investor portal provides guides (KYC, IPO investing, mutual funds) for free . Risk Tip: Beware of “freebie” brokerages that disguise hidden fees.

Week 10: U.S. Markets & Ongoing Learning As a final stage, start learning about global diversification, especially U.S. equities . Indian investors can use RBI’s Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS) to invest up to US$250,000/year abroad. You have two main paths: use Indian brokers that offer U.S. trades (e.g. INDmoney , Vested , or the Appreciate app) or open an international brokerage account (like Interactive Brokers) . Domestic brokers simplify compliance and currency conversion (but may have higher fees), while foreign brokers offer broader stock choices . How-To: Steps for U.S. investing include completing KYC, transferring funds under LRS to USD, and trading on U.S. exchanges from the platform. An example resource outlines opening a US trading account via domestic brokers . Regulation: U.S. markets are regulated by the SEC (akin to SEBI) “to protect investors and promote fair , efficient markets” . Be aware of U.S. trading hours (9:30 AM–4 PM ET) and different tax rules (you’ll owe tax in both countries ). Risk Tip: Currency risk and cross-border taxes apply. Limit initial foreign investments until you understand IRS/FEMA rules. Consider U.S. ETFs (e.g. SPY) or ADRs of Indian companies as easier entries. 19 19 • 20 • 21 22 • 5 Finally, continue learning beyond these weeks. Read foundational books (e.g. Benjamin Graham’s The Intelligent Investor or India-focused Coffee Can Investing ). Enroll in online courses (NSE’s Securities Markets modules, CA Rachana’s courses) and follow YouTube educators like CA Rachana Ranade or Elearnmarkets for visual lessons. Use simulators (Neostox, Investopedia) to keep practicing. Join communities (e.g. Zerodha’s TradingQnA forum ) to ask questions.
